Vector Databases and Embeddings

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, index, and query high-dimensional vector data efficiently. They are essential components in modern AI applications, particularly for similarity search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

What are Embeddings?

Embeddings are dense vector representations of data (text, images, audio) that capture semantic meaning in a continuous vector space. Similar items have similar vector representations, making it possible to measure similarity using mathematical operations.

Types of Embeddings:
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Sentence embeddings (Sentence-BERT)
- Document embeddings
- Image embeddings
- Multimodal embeddings

Vector Database Features

Key features of vector databases include:

1. High-dimensional vector storage
2. Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
3. Similarity metrics (cosine, Euclidean, dot product)
4. Horizontal scalability
5. Real-time indexing and querying
6. Metadata filtering
7. Hybrid search capabilities

Architecture Patterns

Common patterns when using vector databases:

1. ETL Pipeline:
   Extract → Transform → Embed → Load

2. RAG Pipeline:
   Query → Retrieve → Augment → Generate

3. Similarity Search:
   Input → Embed → Search → Rank
